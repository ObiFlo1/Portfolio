        <p>
          Hello! I'm Ruben Flores, a recent graduate of the Galvanize Level Up
          by Hack Reactor coding bootcamp, specializing in PERN stack
          development. With a solid foundation in PostgreSQL, Express.js, React,
          and Node.js, I am actively working on various projects to deepen my
          expertise and showcase my skills. Before transitioning to tech, I
          served in the United States Army for six years as a Sergeant and
          Combat Engineer (E-5). My experience in the military honed my
          leadership, problem-solving abilities, and work ethic. Leading a team
          of soldiers in high-pressure environments taught me the importance of
          collaboration, discipline, and resilienceâ€”qualities I bring to my
          development work. I am passionate about building robust and scalable
          web applications and continuously learning new technologies. My goal
          is to secure a role in a dynamic and innovative company where I can
          contribute to exciting projects and grow as a developer. In my
          personal life, I enjoy lifting weights and training my dog, which
          helps me maintain a balanced and focused mindset. I am eager to bring
          my unique background and skill set to a forward-thinking team and make
          a meaningful impact in the tech industry."
